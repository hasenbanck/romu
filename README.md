A pseudo random number generator using the algorithm [Romu](https://www.romu-random.org/) for the
programing language Rust.

This pseudo random number generator (PRNG) is not intended for cryptographic purposes. This crate only implements the
64-bit "RomuTrio" generator, since it's the recommended generator by the original author.

## Non-linear random number generator

Romu is a non-linear random number generator. That means that the period is probabilistic and is based on the seed.
The bigger the needed period is, the higher the chance it is that the actual period is "too small".

Following formula is given by the author:

```
    P(|cycle contains x<= 2^k|) = 2^k-s+7
        k is size of random numbers needed + 1.
        s is the state size.
```

Example chances for getting a "too small" period:
 * When 2^62 * 64-bit numbers are needed (32 EiB) -> 2^-122 chance
 * When 2^39 * 64-bit numbers are needed (4 TiB) -> 2^-146 chance
 * When 2^36 * 64-bit numbers are needed (512 GiB) -> 2^-149 chance

You can read more about the theory behind Romu in the [official paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.11331) and it's unique
selling points on the [official website](https://www.romu-random.org/) of the original author.

## Seeding

When the user calls the `new()` or `default()` functions of a generator, the implementation
tries to use the best available randomness source to seed the generator (in the following order):
 1. The crate `getrandom` to seed from a high quality randomness source of the operating system.
    The feature `getrandom` must be activated for this.
 2. Use the functionality of the standard library to create a low quality randomness seed (using
    the current time, the thread ID and a memory address).
    The feature `std` must be activated for this.
 3. Use a memory address as a very low randomness seed. If Address Space Layout Randomization
    (ASLR) is supported by the operating system, this should be a pretty "random" value.

It is highly recommended using the `no_std` compatible `getrandom` feature to get high quality
randomness seeds.

The user can always create / update a generator with a user provided seed value.

If the `tls` feature is used, the user should call the `seed()` function to seed the TLS
before creating the first random numbers, since the TLS instance is instantiated with a fixed
value.

## SIMD

The crate currently provides three fallback generators that try to use auto vectorization to speed up the generation
for large amount of random numbers. They should provide good results for SIMD extensions of their same size:

 * `Rng128` - Generator with a width of 128-bit.
 * `Rng256` - Generator with a width of 256-bit.
 * `Rng512` - Generator with a width of 512-bit.
 
Suggested generators for certain CPU SIMD extensions:
 * AVX2: `Rng512`
 * NEON: `Rng128`
 * SSE2: `Rng128`

AVX2 has special hand-written implementations. With AVX2 enabled and using the `Rng512` generator we reached 28 GiB/s
on an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X.

The nightly only feature `unstable_simd` uses the `core::simd` create to implement the SIMD generators.

## Features

The crate is `no_std` compatible.

 * `std` - If `getrandom` is not used or returns an error, the generator will use the thread name and the current
           instance time to create a seed value. Enabled by default.
 * `tls` - Creates static functions that use a thread local version of the generator. Enabled by default.
 * `getrandom` - Uses the `getrandom` crate to create a seed of high randomness. Enabled by default.
 * `unstable_tls` - Uses the unstable `thread_local` feature of Rust nightly. Improves the call times to the
                    thread local functions greatly. 
 * `unstable_simd` - Uses the unstable `std::simd` crate of Rust nightly to provide the SIMD versions of the generators.
